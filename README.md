## Scenario and Problem Statement

**Scenario:**  
New parents often wonder which names are timeless and which are currently trending. Businesses and researchers may also be interested in understanding cultural shifts reflected in naming conventions.

   - Ranked the top 20 male names and determined the rank of "Paul".
   - Found female names present in both 1920 and 2020.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Used Jupyter notebooks to visualize trends and results.
